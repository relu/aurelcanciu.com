Hello Internet,

Although I've been around the webs since at least 2002 (I was a 12 year old kid
back then, just starting to explore the world wide web), I've never actually
considered starting a blog for myself. So here it is, I've finally decided to
do just that. I'm not really sure how often I will write here, or for that
matter, if I'm going to continue writing at all.

Nevertheless, this tiny website will serve as my personal web profile at least.

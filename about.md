I'm Aurel Canciu, a passionate freelance web developer living in
the beautiful city of Cluj-Napoca, Romania. I love working with new and inovative
technologies, getting involved in cool projects and meeting clever and
interesting people.

Currently I enjoy working on full-stack Ruby and/or Javascript web projects,
using Rails, Sinatra, AngularJS, Meteor and others. I'm also interested in
developing mobile web apps, building and architecting API services, DevOps and
Linux server administration. TDD, BDD and CI are also part of my workflow,
making sure to deliver reliable and high quality code.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy hiking, visiting new places, meeting new people
and having a good time with friends and loved ones.
